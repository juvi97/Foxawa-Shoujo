Player: [Ness opened the doorway leading to the hall outside the cafeteria. As I pass through, my body is hit with the opposing force of another, and whomever this was falls to the ground. My chin had bumped into what felt like a head. Rubbing it, I looked down at who’d run into me.] 
Player: “I’m so sorry I…”
(Photo of Fox laying on the hallway floor, shaking of the pain)
Player: [A fox{{boy_girl}} wearing a white coat rubbed {{his_her}} head as{{he_she}} dealt with the impact. ] 
(Foxy BOYGIRL): “I was the one running, not you“. 
[{{he_she}}looked up and our eyes met one another for no longer than seven frames before {{his_hers}} closes shut and picks {{himself_herself}}up. (METAL HITTING WOOD) As {{he_she}} hopped onto the floor I felt a thud. Looking down I saw that both {{his_her}} legs were metallic. 20 whole frames went by before I realized that I’d been staring at them. 
(Hallway) 
Fox (Wary) Ness (Neutral)
[I look up and the fox GIRLs BOYs eyes were at level with mine)
Foxy {{Boy_Girl}} (Wary, blinks eyes): “Hello, Ness. Who’s this person you’ve got with you?”
Ness (Nervous): “Oh, hi Fox. This is Player. I’ve been asked to show him around the school. He’ll be starting classes tomorrow!”
Player: [Ness seemed to be intimidated by Fox’s presence, and I have more than an idea why. The airs of strength and confidence are practically radiating off {{him_her}}. Fox continued to size me up with {{him_her}} quick eyes.]
Fox: (Wary): “…how do you feel about the Aves animal class?”
Player: “[Birds? Why ask me about birds?] Uhh…I’m not overly fixated on them, but I guess they don’t really bother me either.”
Fox (wary) “…” (happy/grinning/laughing eyes closed) “Heh! A purely neutral disposition, then. (Neutral)Anyway, I apologize for running into you. I hope you take a liking to the school.”
Player:  “Yeah, me too. Thanks!”
Fox: “See you, Ness.”
Ness: (neutral) “Goodbye, Fox.”
(Fox exits)
Player: [As {{he_she}} stepped through the doorway into the cafeteria, I tried to get a better look at {{his_her}} legs again but only caught a glimpse before the doors disrupted my view.] 
Ness: (Neutral):”Yeah, that’s Fox. {{his_her}} dad’s a fighter pilot, and HEs SHEs hoping to be one as well. SO KAKUII, or cool to you non weeber.”
Player: “I swear I wish I could work myself for longer without spending days not writing script for this game. People are depending on me and I’ve got to deliver!!!! End”
